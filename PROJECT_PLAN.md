# ExpenseTracker: Personal Finance Management Application

## Project Overview
ExpenseTracker is a comprehensive personal finance management application designed to help users track, analyze, and optimize their spending habits. The application combines traditional manual expense tracking with innovative OCR technology to simplify the process of recording expenses from UPI payment screenshots. Advanced data visualization provides users with insights into their spending patterns, while a machine learning component automatically categorizes expenses to reduce manual input.
